# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration. You can clone it directly into your Neovim configuration directory with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juzhuochen/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

## New Features

I've recently added some new features to enhance the functionality of this configuration:

- **Mason**: A new LSP management tool has been added to the configuration. This will help in managing and configuring the various LSPs used in this setup.
- **Transparent Appearance**: The appearance of Neovim has been updated to have a transparent background. This provides a sleek and modern look to your coding environment.
- **Auto Completion**: This feature has been added to improve coding efficiency. It provides intelligent suggestions as you type.
- **Git Integration**: This allows you to perform git operations directly from within Neovim, making version control more seamless and integrated.

## Future Work

Some other functions are still under development and will be coming soon. Stay tuned for updates!

Thank you for your interest in this Neovim configuration. If you have any issues or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

I hope this updated README meets your needs! If you have any other changes in mind, feel free to let me know.
